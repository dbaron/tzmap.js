This is tzmap.js, a library for working with the geography of time zones
from JavaScript.

This is a companion library to tz.js, providing the geography-related
features.  It is intended to support applications that want to map
locations (latitude/longitude pairs) to time zone names and applications
that want to draw maps of time zones.

It incorporates data from http://efele.net/maps/tz/ , "A set of
shapefiles for the TZ timezones", available under CC0.
