This is tzmap.js, a library for working with the geography of time zones
from JavaScript.

This is a companion library to tz.js, providing the geography-related
features.  It is intended to support applications that want to map
locations (latitude/longitude pairs) to time zone names and applications
that want to draw maps of time zones.

It incorporates data from http://efele.net/maps/tz/ , "A set of
shapefiles for the TZ timezones", available under CC0.

Files currently in the distribution are:

    The Python Shapefile Library (under its own license).

  shapefile-to-json.py

    Code to construct the JSON data needed by tzmap.js from the
    tzmap shapefiles.

The library has the goal of providing these basic functions:

 (1) Map a (lat,lon) pair to zero or one timezones.

 (2) Get the shape outlines for a given timezone to draw the boundaries
     of a TZ database timezone.

 (3) Merge the shape outlines for adjacent timezones in order to draw
     the boundaries of a set of adjacent timezones (eliminating edges
     that were between two merged zones).  This allows drawing maps
     showing the timezone lines at a given point in time.

This has the following implications for data structures:

  For (1), we want a quick test that allows rapidly eliminating most
  timezones; this is done by storing the N/E/S/W edges of the smallest
  rectangle enclosing all of the zone's polygons.

  For (3), we want each polygon for the zone to be stored as a list of
  (segment, direction-on-segment) pairs, and each segment to know which
  one or two zones it separates.
